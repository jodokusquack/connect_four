# Connect Four!

This is the game Connect Four for the command line!
It is a project from [The Odin
Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/testing-your-ruby-code?ref=lnav),
a free curriculum for learning Web Development.

The goal of the project is to get familiar with TDD as a technique to
develop a project.
For testing, the framework RSpec is used.

To play the game, clone the project onto your computer and then execute
'connect_four.rb'.
